wide and deep model practices



Background

open source wdl model could by found here [tf models-wide_deep](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/wide_deep)

however, it only could be run locally, after refine it to distribution version, I put it running on spark using tfos[TensorflowOnSpark](https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark/).

Practices
